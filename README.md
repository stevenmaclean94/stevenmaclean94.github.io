### Master's Thesis
Modeling and Simulation of a Sounding Rocket Active Stabilization System

*Abstract*

The Horizon Simulation Framework is a modeling and simulation framework developed to verify system level requirements. In this thesis, the framework is extended to include the Dynamic position type that existed in the early development phase of the framework. The Dynamic position type is tested through the modeling and simulation of a sounding rocket. An active control system based on linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) control theory is implemented and tested in the simulation to determine the overall effect on altitude. A first order aerodynamics and aeroprediction model are created within the framework to allow for rapid changes early in the design process of the sounding rocket. The flight dynamics are compared to two different sounding rocket flights and the aeroprediction model is validated against public wind tunnel test data.
